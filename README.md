# ratcl
a Random-ass Turing Complete Language

<hr>

For info on how this esolang works, go [here](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Random-ass_Turing_Complete_Language). Currently it's unfinished, and I started writing the wiki page during my science class.

Currently to use it you have to have a file in the same directory named `code.ratcl`, and then run the `.py` file.
